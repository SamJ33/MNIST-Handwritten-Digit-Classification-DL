# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification DL 

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using the MNIST dataset. 
A neural network model is trained to classify digits (0–9) and can also be tested on custom handwritten images.

---

##  Key Features
- Trained on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training images and 10,000 test images).
- End-to-end preprocessing pipeline:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Resizing to **28×28 pixels**
  - Pixel value normalization
- Predicts digits from both the dataset and user-provided images.

---

##  Tech Stack:
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **OpenCV**
- **Matplotlib**

---

##  Usage
- The model can be trained on the MNIST dataset for digit classification.
- If you want to try the prediction system, simply **upload a handwritten digit image** and the model will attempt to recognize it.
